Asset: MaterialFunction ParallaxOcclusionMapping
{
    Description: Parallax Occlusion Mapping uses Ray Tracing to find the correct offsets at each point. Keep in mind that the material cost will not be easily trackable using the instruction count or shader complexity view due to the nature of the loops involved. Use the debug emissive colors to get an idea of expense based on your specified Min and Max Step sizes.
